<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION"></a>INTRODUCTION</h2>


<p>In offering this collection of translations from early Irish poetry to a
wider public I feel that I am expected to give a brief account of the
literature from which they are taken&mdash;a literature so little known that
its very existence has been doubted or denied by some, while others, who
had the misfortune to make its acquaintance in ill-chosen or inadequate
renderings, have refused to recognise any merit in it. The bias and
ignorance of English historians and of many professed students of Irish
history, who continue to write without a first-hand knowledge of its
sources, have also reacted unfavourably upon the study of Irish
literature. Slowly, however, the fact is becoming recognised in ever wider
circles that the vernacular literature of ancient Ireland is the most
primitive and original among the literatures of Western Europe, and that
in its origins and development it affords a most fascinating study.
Whatever may be its intrinsic merit, its importance as the earliest voice
from the dawn of West European civilisation cannot be denied.</p>

<p>Time and again in the course of their history the nations of Western and
Northern Europe have had to struggle hard for the preservation of their
national life against a powerful denationalising influence proceeding from
Rome. Those among them who underwent the Roman conquest lost early,
together with their liberty, their most precious national possession,
their native language and with it their vernacular literature. Less than a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span>century after the slaughter of Vercingetorix Romanised Gauls were
carrying off the palm of Roman eloquence. By the fifth century the Gaulish
language was everywhere extinct, without having left behind a single
record of its literature. The same fate was shared by all Celtic
nationalities of the Continent, and by those numerous Germanic tribes that
were conquered by Rome, or came within the sphere of the later Roman
civilisation. In Britain, where the Roman occupation was only temporary,
its denationalising effect may be gauged by the numerous Latin loan-words
preserved to the present day in the Welsh language, by the partial
Romanisation of British personal proper names, by the early inscribed
stones, which, unlike those of Ireland, are all in Latin, and by the late
and slow beginnings of a literature in the vernacular.</p>

<p>It was only on the outskirts of the Continental world, and beyond the sway
and influence of the Roman Empire, that some vigorous nations preserved
their national institutions intact, and among them there are only three
whom letters reached early enough to leave behind some record of their
pagan civilisation in a vernacular literature. These were the Irish, the
Anglo-Saxons, and, comparative latecomers, the Icelanders.</p>

<p>Again, when Christianity came with the authority of Rome and in the Latin
language, now imbued with an additional sanctity, there ensued in all
nations a struggle between the vernacular and the foreign tongue for
obtaining the rank of a literary language&mdash;a struggle from which the
languages of the Continental nations, as well as of Britain, emerged only
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</a></span>slowly and late. It is not till the end of the eleventh century that we
find the beginnings of a national literature in France and Germany. In
Ireland, on the other hand, which had received her Christianity not direct
from Rome but from Britain and Gaul, and where the Church, far removed
from the centre of Roman influence and cut off from the rest of
Christendom, was developing on national lines, vernacular literature
received a fresh impulse from the new faith. A flourishing primitive
Christian literature arose. The national language was employed not only
for the purposes of instruction and devotion, in tombstone or other
inscriptions, but also in religious prose and poetry, and, still more
remarkable, in learned writings. There can, I think, be little doubt that
we should hardly have any early records of Anglo-Saxon literature if the
English had not in the first instance received Christianity from the
Irish. It had been the influence and example of those Irish missionaries
who converted Northumberland that taught the Anglian monk to preserve and
cultivate his national literature.</p>

<p>Ireland had become the heiress of the classical and theological learning
of the Western Empire of the third and fourth centuries, and a period of
humanism was thus ushered in which reached its culmination during the
sixth and following centuries, the Golden Age of Irish civilisation. The
charge that is so often levelled against Irish history, that it has been,
as it were, in a backwater, where only the fainter wash of the larger
currents reaches, cannot apply to this period. For once, at any rate,
Ireland drew upon herself the eyes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</a></span> of the whole world, not, as so often
in later times, by her unparalleled sufferings, but as the one haven of
rest in a turbulent world overrun by hordes of barbarians, as the great
seminary of Christian and classical learning, 'the quiet habitation of
sanctity and literature,' as Doctor Johnson called her in a memorable
letter written to Charles O'Connor. Her sons, carrying Christianity and a
new humanism over Great Britain and the Continent, became the teachers of
whole nations, the counsellors of kings and emperors. For once, if but for
a century or two, the Celtic spirit dominated a large part of the Western
world, and Celtic ideals imparted a new life to a decadent civilisation
until they succumbed, not altogether to the benefit of mankind, before a
mightier system&mdash;that of Rome.</p>

<p>It was during this period that the oral literature, handed down by many
generations of bards and story-tellers, was first written down in the
monasteries. Unfortunately, not a single tale, only two or three poems,
have come down to us from these early centuries in contemporary
manuscripts. In Ireland nearly all old MSS. were destroyed during the
Viking terror which burst upon the island at the end of the eighth
century.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> But, from the eleventh century onward, we have an almost
unbroken series of hundreds of MSS. in which all that had escaped
destruction was collected and arranged. Many of the tales and poems thus
preserved were undoubtedly originally composed in the eighth century; some
few perhaps in the seventh; and as Irish scholarship advances, it is not
unlikely that fragments of poetry will be found which, from linguistic or
internal evidence, may be claimed for the sixth century.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[Pg xi]</a></span></p>

<p>The Celtic nations stand almost alone in this, that they did not employ
poetry for epical narrative. There are no ancient Irish epics or ballads.
So much was prose the natural vehicle of expression for Gaelic narrative,
that when in later centuries the Arthurian epics were done into Gaelic,
they were all turned from poetry into prose. At the same time, most Irish
tales and stories are interspersed with lyrics put into the mouth of the
principal heroes, after the manner of the <i>cante fable</i>, most familiar to
modern readers from the French story of <i>Aucassin et Nicolete</i>. My
collection begins with a few specimens of such poems.</p>

<p>The purely lyrical poetry of ancient Ireland may be roughly divided into
two sections&mdash;that of the professional bard attached to the court and
person of a chief; and that of the unattached poet, whether monk or
itinerant bard.</p>

<p>From the earliest times we know the names of many famous bards of ancient
Ireland and Scotland. Their songs are interwoven with the history of the
dynasties and the great houses of the country whose retainers they were,
and whose joys and sorrows they shared and expressed. Thus they became the
chroniclers of many historical events. Of the oldest bardic poetry very
little has as yet been published, and less translated. But many fine
examples of a later age will be found in Standish Hayes O'Grady's
<i>Catalogue of Irish Manuscripts in the British Museum</i>, a book which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[Pg xii]</a></span>
makes one realise more clearly than any other that the true history of
Ireland has never yet been written. My own specimens from the earlier
centuries include several laments and a sword-song, a species of bardic
composition which the Gaels share with the Norse.</p>

<p>Religious poetry ranges from single quatrains to lengthy compositions
dealing with all the varied aspects of religious life. Many of them give
us a fascinating insight into the peculiar character of the early Irish
Church, which differed in so many ways from the rest of the Christian
world. We see the hermit in his lonely cell, the monk at his devotions or
at his work of copying in the scriptorium or under the open sky; or we
hear the ascetic who, alone or with twelve chosen companions, has left one
of the great monasteries in order to live in greater solitude among the
woods or mountains, or on a lonely island. The fact that so many of these
poems are fathered upon well-known saints emphasises the friendly attitude
of the native clergy towards vernacular poetry.</p>

<p>In Nature poetry the Gaelic muse may vie with that of any other nation.
Indeed, these poems occupy a unique position in the literature of the
world. To seek out and watch and love Nature, in its tiniest phenomena as
in its grandest, was given to no people so early and so fully as to the
Celt. Many hundreds of Gaelic and Welsh poems testify to this fact.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> It
is a characteristic of these poems that in none of them do we get an
elaborate or sustained description of any scene or scenery, but rather a
succession of pictures and images which the poet, like an impressionist,
calls up before us by light and skilful touches. Like the Japanese, the
Celts were always quick to take an artistic hint; they avoid the obvious
and the commonplace; the half-said thing to them is dearest.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[Pg xiii]</a></span></p>

<p>Of ancient love-songs comparatively little has come down to us. What we
have are mostly laments for departed lovers. He who would have further
examples of Gaelic love-poetry must turn to modern collections, among
which the <i>Love-Songs of Connaught</i>, collected and translated by Douglas
Hyde, occupy the foremost place.</p>

<p>A word on the metrical system of Irish poetry may conclude this rapid
sketch. The original type from which the great variety of Irish metres has
sprung is the catalectic trochaic tetrameter of Latin poetry, as in the
well-known popular song of C&aelig;sar's soldiers:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Caesar Gallias subegit,      Nicomedes Caesarem,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ecce Caesar nunc triumphat      qui subegit Gallias';<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>or in St. Hilary's <i>Hymnus in laudem Christi</i>, beginning:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Ymnum dicat turba fratrum,      ymnum cantus personet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Christo regi concinentes      laudem demus debitam.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The commonest stanza is a quatrain consisting of four heptasyllabic lines
with the rhyme at the end of the couplet. In my renderings I have made no
attempt at either rhythm or rhyme; but I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[Pg xiv]</a></span> have printed the stanzas so as
to show the structure of the poem. For merely practical reasons I have, in
some cases, printed them in the form of couplets, in others in that of
verse-lines.</p>

<p>I must not conclude without recording here also, as I have done elsewhere,
my gratitude for the constant help and advice given to me in these
translations by my old friend and colleague, Professor J.M. Mackay.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_DEVILS_TRIBUTE_TO_MOLING" id="THE_DEVILS_TRIBUTE_TO_MOLING"></a>THE DEVIL'S TRIBUTE TO MOLING</h2>


<div class="blockquot"><p>Once as Moling was praying in his church he saw a man coming
in to him. Purple raiment he wore and a distinguished form
had he. 'Well met, cleric!' says he. 'Amen!' says Moling.
'Why dost thou not salute me?' says the man. 'Who art thou?'
says Moling. 'I am Christ, the Son of God,' he answers. 'I
do not know that,' says Moling. 'When Christ used to come to
converse with God's servants, 'twas not in purple or with
royal pomp he would come, but in the shape of a leper.'
'Then dost thou not believe in me?' says the man. 'Whom dost
thou suppose to be here?' 'I suppose,' says Moling, 'that it
is the Devil for my hurt.' 'Thy unbelief will be ill for
thee,' says the man. 'Well,' says Moling, raising the
Gospel, 'here is thy successor, the Gospel of Christ.'
'Raise it not, cleric!' says the Devil; 'it is as thou
thinkest: I am the man of tribulations.' 'Wherefore hast
thou come?' says Moling. 'That thou mayst bestow a blessing
upon me.' 'I will not bestow it,' says Moling, 'for thou
dost not deserve it. Besides, what good could it do thee?'
'If,' says the Devil, 'thou shouldst go into a tub of honey
and bathe therein with thy raiment on, its odour would
remain upon thee unless the raiment were washed.' 'How would
that affect thee?' asks Moling. 'Because, though thy
blessing do nought else to me, its good luck and its virtue
and its blossom will be on me externally.' 'Thou shalt not
have it,' says Moling, 'for thou deservest it not.' 'Well,'
said the Devil, 'then bestow the full of a curse on me.'
'What good were that to thee?' asks Moling. 'The venom and
the hurt of the curse will be on the lips from which it will
come.' 'Go,' says Moling; 'thou hast no right to a
blessing.' 'Better were it for me that I had. How shall I
earn it?' 'By service to God,' says Moling. 'Woe is me!'
says the Devil, 'I cannot bring it.' 'Even a trifle of
study.' 'Thine own study is not greater, and yet it helps me
not.' 'Fasting, then,' says Moling. 'I have been fasting
since the beginning of the world, and not the better thereof
am I.' 'Making genuflexions,' says Moling. 'I cannot bend
forward,' says the Devil, 'for backwards are my knees.' 'Go
forth,' says Moling; 'I cannot teach thee nor help thee.'
Then the Devil said:</p></div>

<h2><a name="LIADIN_AND_CURITHIR" id="LIADIN_AND_CURITHIR"></a>LIADIN AND CURITHIR</h2>


<div class="blockquot"><p>Liadin of Corkaguiney, a poetess, went visiting into the
country of Connaught. There Curithir, himself a poet, made
an ale-feast for her. 'Why should not we two unite, Liadin?'
saith Curithir. 'A son of us two would be famous.' 'Do not
let us do so now,' saith she, 'lest my round of visiting be
ruined for me. If you will come for me again at my home, I
shall go with you.' That fell so. Southward he went, and a
single gillie behind him with his poet's dress in a bag upon
his back, while Curithir himself was in a poor garb. There
were spear-heads in the bag also. He went till he was at the
well beside Liadin's court. There he took his crimson dress
about him, and the heads were put upon their shafts, and he
stood brandishing them.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Liadin had made a vow of chastity; but faithful to
her word she went with him. They proceed to the monastery of
Clonfert, where they put themselves under the spiritual
direction of Cummin, son of Fiachna. He first imposes a
slight probation upon them, allowing them to converse
without seeing each other. Then, challenged by Liadin, he
permits them a perilous freedom. In the result he banishes
Curithir, who thenceforward renounces love and becomes a
pilgrim. When Liadin still seeks him he crosses the sea. She
returns to the scene of their penance, and shortly dies.
When all is over, Cummin lovingly lays the stone where she
had mourned her love, and upon which she died, over the
grave of the unhappy maiden.</p></div>

<p>Three slender things that best support the world: the slender stream of
milk from the cow's dug into the pail; the slender blade of green corn
upon the ground; the slender thread over the hand of a skilled woman.</p>

<p>The three worst welcomes: a handicraft in the same house with the inmates;
scalding water upon your feet; salt food without a drink.</p>

<p>Three rejoicings followed by sorrow: a wooer's, a thief's, a
tale-bearer's.</p>

<p>Three rude ones of the world: a youngster mocking an old man; a robust
person mocking an invalid; a wise man mocking a fool.</p>

<p>Three fair things that hide ugliness: good manners in the ill-favoured;
skill in a serf; wisdom in the misshapen.</p>

<p>Three sparks that kindle love: a face, demeanour, speech.</p>

<p>Three glories of a gathering: a beautiful wife, a good horse, a swift
hound.</p>

<p>Three fewnesses that are better than plenty: a fewness of fine words; a
fewness of cows in grass; a fewness of friends around good ale.</p>

<p>Three ruins of a tribe: a lying chief, a false judge, a lustful priest.</p>

<p>Three laughing-stocks of the world: an angry man, a jealous man, a
niggard.</p>

<p>Three signs of ill-breeding: a long visit, staring, constant questioning.</p>

<p>Three signs of a fop: the track of his comb in his hair; the track of his
teeth in his food; the track of his stick behind him.</p>

<p>Three idiots of a bad guest-house: an old hag with a chronic cough; a
brainless tartar of a girl; a hobgoblin of a gillie.</p>

<p>Three things that constitute a physician: a complete cure; leaving no
blemish behind; a painless examination.</p>

<p>Three things betokening trouble: holding plough-land in common; performing
feats together; alliance in marriage.</p>

<p>Three nurses of theft: a wood, a cloak, night.</p>

<p>Three false sisters: 'perhaps,' 'may be,' 'I dare say.'</p>

<p>Three timid brothers: 'hush!' 'stop!' 'listen!'</p>

<p>Three sounds of increase: the lowing of a cow in milk; the din of a
smithy; the swish of a plough.</p>

<p>Three steadinesses of good womanhood: keeping a steady tongue; a steady
chastity; a steady housewifery.</p>

<p>Three excellences of dress: elegance, comfort, lastingness.</p>

<p>Three candles that illume every darkness: truth, nature, knowledge.</p>

<p>Three keys that unlock thoughts: drunkenness, trustfulness, love.</p>

<p>Three youthful sisters: desire, beauty, generosity.</p>

<p>Three aged sisters: groaning, chastity, ugliness.</p>

<p>Three nurses of high spirits: pride, wooing, drunkenness.</p>

<p>Three coffers whose depth is not known: the coffers of a chieftain, of the
Church, of a privileged poet.</p>

<p>Three things that ruin wisdom: ignorance, inaccurate knowledge,
forgetfulness.</p>

<p>Three things that are best for a chief: justice, peace, an army.</p>

<p>Three things that are worst for a chief: sloth, treachery, evil counsel.</p>

<p>Three services, the worst that a man can serve: serving a bad woman, a bad
lord, and bad land.</p>

<p>Three lawful handbreadths: a handbreadth between shoes and hose, between
ear and hair, and between the fringe of the tunic and the knee.</p>

<p>Three angry sisters: blasphemy, strife, foul-mouthedness.</p>

<p>Three disrespectful sisters: importunity, frivolity, flightiness.</p>

<h2><a name="NOTES" id="NOTES"></a>NOTES</h2>


<p>'<a href="#THE_ISLES_OF_THE_HAPPY">The Isles of the Happy</a>' and '<a href="#THE_SEA-GODS_ADDRESS_TO_BRAN">The Sea-god's Address to Bran</a>' are poems
interspersed in the prose tale called 'The Voyage of Bran son of Febal to
the Land of the Living.' For text and translation see my edition (London:
D. Nutt, 1895), pp. 4 and 16. The tale was probably first written down
early in the eighth, perhaps late in the seventh century.</p>

<p>'<a href="#THE_TRYST_AFTER_DEATH">The Tryst after Death</a>' (<i>Reicne Fothaid Canainne</i>) belongs to the ninth
century. For the original text and translation see my 'Fianaigecht, a
collection of hitherto inedited Irish poems and tales relating to Finn and
his Fiana' (Dublin: Hodges, Figgis and Co., 1910), p. 10 ff.</p>

<p>'<a href="#DEIRDRES_FAREWELL_TO_SCOTLAND">Deirdre's Farewell to Scotland</a>' and '<a href="#DEIRDRES_LAMENT">Deirdre's Lament</a>' are taken from the
well-known tale called 'The Death of the Children of Usnech.' The text
which is here rendered is that of the Middle-Irish version edited and
translated by Whitley Stokes (<i>Irische Texte</i>, ii., Leipzig, 1884), pp.
127 and 145. My rendering follows in the main that of Stokes.</p>

<p>'<a href="#THE_HOSTS_OF_FAERY">The Hosts of Faery</a>.'&mdash;From the tale called 'Laegaire mac Crimthainn's
Visit to the Fairy Realm of Mag Mell,' the oldest copy of which is found
in the Book of Leinster, a MS. of the twelfth century, p. 275 <i>b</i>. See
S.H. O'Grady's <i>Silva Gadelica</i> (Williams and Norgate, 1892), vol. i. p.
256; vol. ii. p. 290, where, however, the verse is not translated.</p>

<p>The two poems from the '<a href="#FROM_THE_VISION_OF_MAC_CONGLINNE">Vision of MacConglinne</a>' are taken from my
translation of the twelfth-century burlesque so called (D. Nutt, 1892),
pp. 34 and 78.</p>

<p>'<a href="#A_DIRGE_FOR_KING_NIALL_OF_THE_NINE_HOSTAGES">A Dirge for King Niall of the Nine Hostages</a>.'&mdash;Text and translation in
<i>Festschrift f&uuml;r Whitley Stokes</i> (Harrassowitz, Leipzig, 1900), p. 1 ff.,
and in the <i>Gaelic Journal</i>, x.p. 578 ff. Late eighth or early ninth
century.</p>

<p>'<a href="#THE_SONG_OF_CARROLLS_SWORD_ad_909">The Song of Carroll's Sword</a>.'&mdash;Edited and translated in <i>Revue Celtique</i>,
xx. p. 7 ff., and again in the <i>Gaelic Journal</i>, x.p. 613. Dall&aacute;n mac
M&oacute;re, to whom the poem is ascribed, was chief bard to King Carroll
(Cerball) mac Muiregan of Leinster, who reigned from about <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 885 to
909.</p>

<p>'<a href="#EOCHAID_ON_THE_DEATH_OF_KING_AED_MAC_DOMNAILL_UA_NEILL20">Eochaid's Lament</a>.'&mdash;Text published in <i>Archiv f&uuml;r celtische
Lexikographie</i> (Niemeyer, Halle a. S., 1907), vol. iii. p. 304.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span></p>
<p>'<a href="#ERARD_MAC_COISSE_ON_THE_DEATH_OF_KING_MALACHY_II23">Lament on King Malachy II</a>.'&mdash;<i>Ibid.</i>, p. 305.</p>

<p>'<a href="#KING_AND_HERMIT">King and Hermit</a>.'&mdash;First published and translated by me under that title
with Messrs. D. Nutt, 1901. The language is that of the tenth century.</p>

<p>'<a href="#SONG_OF_THE_SEA">Song of the Sea</a>.'&mdash;Text and translation in <i>Otia Merseiana</i> (the
publication of the Arts Faculty, University College, Liverpool), vol. ii.
p. 76 ff. Though the poem is ascribed to the celebrated poet Rumann, who
died in 748, its language points to the eleventh century.</p>

<p>'<a href="#SUMMER_HAS_COME">Summer has come</a>.'&mdash;Text and translation in my <i>Four Songs of Summer and
Winter</i> (D. Nutt, 1903), p. 20 ff. The piece probably dates from the tenth
century.</p>

<p>'<a href="#SONG_OF_SUMMER">Song of Summer</a>.'&mdash;<i>Ibid.</i>, p. 8 ff., and <i>&Eacute;riu</i>, the Journal of the
School of Irish Learning, i. p. 186. The date is the ninth century, I
think.</p>

<p>'<a href="#SUMMER_IS_GONE">Summer is gone</a>.'&mdash;<i>Ibid.</i>, p. 14. Ninth century.</p>

<p>'<a href="#A_SONG_OF_WINTER">A Song of Winter</a>.'&mdash;From the story called 'The Hiding of the Hill of
Howth,' first printed and translated by me in <i>Revue Celtique</i>, xi. p. 125
ff. Probably tenth century.</p>

<p>'<a href="#ARRAN">Arran</a>.'&mdash;Taken from the thirteenth-century prose tale called <i>Agallamh na
Sen&oacute;rach</i>, edited and translated by S.H. O'Grady in <i>Silva Gadelica</i>. The
poem refers to the island in the Firth of Clyde.</p>

<p>'<a href="#THE_SONG_OF_CREDE_DAUGHTER_OF_GUARE">The Song of Crede, daughter of Guare</a>.'&mdash;See text and translation in
<i>&Eacute;riu</i>, ii. p. 15 ff. Probably tenth century.</p>

<p>'<a href="#LIADIN_AND_CURITHIR">Liadin and Curithir</a>.'&mdash;First published and translated by me under that
title with Messrs. D. Nutt, 1902. It belongs to the ninth century.</p>

<p>'<a href="#THE_DEERS_CRY">The Deer's Cry</a>.'&mdash;For the text and translation see Stokes and Strachan,
<i>Thesaurus Palaeohibernicus</i> (University Press, Cambridge), vol. ii. p.
354. I have adopted the translation there given except in some details.
The hymn in the form in which it has come down to us cannot be earlier
than the eighth century.</p>

<p>'<a href="#AN_EVEN-SONG">An Evening Song</a>.'&mdash;Printed in my <i>Selections from Old-Irish Poetry</i>, p.
1. Though ascribed to Patrick, the piece cannot be older than the tenth
century.</p>

<p>'<a href="#PATRICKS_BLESSING_ON_MUNSTER">Patrick's Blessing on Munster</a>.'&mdash;Taken from the <i>Tripartite Life of
Patrick</i>, edited by Whitley Stokes (Rolls Series, London, 1887), p. 216.
Not earlier than the ninth century.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span></p>
<p>'<a href="#THE_HERMITS_SONG">The Hermit's Song</a>.'&mdash;See <i>&Eacute;riu</i>, vol. i. p. 39, where the Irish text will
be found. The poem dates from the ninth century.</p>

<p>'<a href="#A_PRAYER_TO_THE_VIRGIN">A Prayer to the Virgin</a>.'&mdash;See Strachan's edition of the original in
<i>&Eacute;riu</i>, i. p. 122. There is another copy in the Bodleian MS. Laud 615, p.
91, from which I have taken some better readings. The poem is hardly
earlier than the tenth century.</p>

<p>'<a href="#EVES_LAMENT">Eve's Lament</a>.'&mdash;See <i>&Eacute;riu</i>, iii. p. 148. The date is probably the late
tenth or early eleventh century.</p>

<p>'<a href="#ON_THE_FLIGHTINESS_OF_THOUGHT">On the Flightiness of Thought</a>.'&mdash;See <i>&Eacute;riu</i>, iii. p. 13. Tenth century.</p>

<p>'<a href="#TO_CRINOG">To Crinog</a>.'&mdash;The Irish text was published by me in the <i>Zeitschrift f&uuml;r
celtische Philologie</i>, vol. vi. p. 257. The date of the poem is the tenth
century. Crinog was evidently what is known in the literature of early
Christianity as <ins class="greek" title="iagap&ecirc;t&ecirc;">&#953;&#945;&#947;&#945;&#960;&#951;&#964;&#951;</ins>, <i>virgo subintroducta</i> (<ins class="greek" title="syneisaktos">&#963;&#965;&#957;&#949;&#953;&#963;&#945;&#954;&#964;&#959;&#963;</ins>)
or <i>conhospita</i>, <i>i.e.</i> a nun who lived with a priest, monk,
or hermit like a sister or 'spiritual wife' (<i>uxor spiritualis</i>). This
practice, which was early suppressed and abandoned everywhere else, seems
to have survived in the Irish Church till the tenth century. See on the
whole subject H. Achelis, <i>Virgines Subintroductae</i>, ein Beitrag zu i.,
Kor. vii. (Leipzig, 1902).</p>

<p>'<a href="#THE_DEVILS_TRIBUTE_TO_MOLING">The Devil's Tribute to Moling</a>.'&mdash;For text and translation see Whitley
Stokes's <i>Goidelica</i>, 2nd ed., p. 180, and his edition of <i>F&eacute;lire
Oingusso</i>, p. 154 ff. I have in the main followed Stokes's rendering.</p>

<p>'<a href="#MAELISUS_HYMN_TO_THE_ARCHANGEL_MICHAEL">Maelisu's Hymn to the Archangel Michael</a>.'&mdash;Text and translation in the
<i>Gaelic Journal</i>, vol. iv. p. 56. Maelisu ua Brolch&aacute;in was a writer of
religious poetry both in Irish and Latin, who died in 1056.</p>

<p>'<a href="#THE_MOTHERS_LAMENT_AT_THE_SLAUGHTER_OF_THE_INNOCENTS">The Mothers' Lament at the Slaughter of the Innocents</a>.'&mdash;See text and
translation in the <i>Gaelic Journal</i>, iv. p. 89. The piece probably belongs
to the eleventh century.</p>

<p>'<a href="#COLUM_CILLES_GREETING_TO_IRELAND">Colum Cille's Greeting to Ireland</a>.'&mdash;From Reeves' edition of Adamnan's
<i>Life of St. Columba</i>, p. 285. The poem, like most of those ascribed to
this saint, is late, belonging probably to the twelfth century.</p>

<p>'<a href="#THE_LAMENT_OF_THE_OLD_WOMAN_OF_BEARE">The Lament of the Old Woman of Beare</a>.'&mdash;Text and translation in <i>Otia
Merseiana</i>, i. p. 119 ff. The language of the poem points to the late tenth
century.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span></p>
<p>'<a href="#THE_DESERTED_HOME">The Deserted Home</a>.'&mdash;See <i>Gaelic Journal</i>, iv. p. 42. Probably eleventh
century.</p>

<p>'<a href="#COLUM_CILLE_THE_SCRIBE">Colum Cille the Scribe</a>.'&mdash;See <i>Gaelic Journal</i>, viii. p. 49. Probably
eleventh century.</p>

<p>'<a href="#THE_MONK_AND_HIS_PET_CAT">The Monk and his Pet Cat</a>.'&mdash;Text and translation in <i>Thesaurus
Palaeohibernicus</i>, ii. p. 293. I have made my own translation. The
language is that of the late eighth or early ninth century.</p>
